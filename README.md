# Advanced Vue 3 Form 
This is a revised version of `distraction-free-form` example that was created back in July 2019.

## Demo: https://advanced-vue3-form.surge.sh/ 

#### This Typeform like form is built using:
- Vue 3 with:
    - Render functions
    - Functional components 
    - Single file components,
    - Composables, 
    - Provide/Inject,
    - Transitions
- Pinia,
- Vuelidate and
- Animate.css

## What's new

The ideas described in **[Building an Interactive and Distraction-free Form with Vue](https://medium.com/vue-mastery/building-an-interactive-and-distraction-free-form-with-vue-bfe23907e981)** article still applies here in this Vue 3 example. 

However, there are some technical differences that follow Vue 3 conventions. Diagrams seen in the article above have been updated as well.

## Render functions in Vue 3

Function to create virtual node was available in `render()` function by default in Vue 2. This same function needs to be imported from vue 3 now. Here's the signature of the new render function in Vue 3.

See how the render function is used in **[VueForm.js](src/components/VueForm.js)** to load dynamic form-field components as per defined in **[form configuration](/src/config/config.js)**.

## Functional components in Vue 3

Everything we knew about functional component in Vue 2 is true for Vue 3 as well. However, there are some differences in how we write functional component in Vue 3. 

- Functional component now has the same signature as `setup()` function
- Functional component doesn't need to have `function:true` as we had to in options API.

Functional components are applicable for both transitions. 
- **[Data-driven transition](/src/components/Transitions/DataDrivenTransition.js)**
- **[Type-based transition](/src/components/Transitions/TypeBasedTransition.js)**

```js
import { h, Transition } from "vue";

function MyComponent(props, { slots, emit, attrs }) {

    // return the render function
    return () => h(Transition, props, slots)
}
```

Previously, we rendered `<Transition>` component by adding it as a string, like: `return h("transition", data, context.children)`.
In Vue 3, we need to import an actual `Transition` component from `vue` and then pass it into render function `h()`.

## From mixins to composables

Back in Vue 2 example, we used mixins to share the formState and formData. That same mixin is now converted into `useForm` composable, that provides formState, formData and other helper methods to navigate individual fields within the form. 

See all four **[composables](/src/composables)**  used in this example.

## From Vuex to Pinia

Back in Vue 2 example, we used Vuex store to create empty store based on form configuration. In this Vue 3 example, we use Pinia to create empty store. 

```js
// src/components/VueForm.js

// Set empty store for form data
const store = useLeadStore();

props.formConfig.forEach((field) => {
switch (field.type) {
    case "checkbox":
    return (store.formData[field.name] = []);
    case "radio":
    return (store.formData[field.name] = "");
    case "information":
    break;
    default:
    return (store.formData[field.name] = "");
}
});
```

As soon as we load the form, we have this ðŸ‘† empty store created for us to store user entered values. The **[pinia store](/src/stores/LeadStore.js)** looks a lot simpler now as well.

## Vuelidate and 3 composables

Vuelidate is used for form validation. There are two custom composables, `useFormField` and `useValidation` along with `useVulidate` composable that's provided by Vuelidate - all three of these composables take care of individual field validation before we can move onto the next step in the form.

![Vuelidate and Composables](/docs/images/Form-Template.png)

## Provide Inject

Reactive provide/inject is used to make sure `formState` is available in child components that are not in the direct hierarchy.

```js
// src/components/FormTemplate.vue

provide("vueform", {
  validateField,
  formState,
});
```

## $attrs in Vue 3

Back in Vue 2, `$attrs` were applied to component by simply binding them with dynamic component using 
`v-bind="{ ...field.options.attrs }"`

```html
<!-- src/components/FormTemplate.vue -->
<Component 
    v-model="formData[field.name]" 
    :is="field.component" 
    v-bind="{ ...field.options.attrs }"
/>
```

In Vue 3, `$attrs` are passed the same way, `v-bind="{ ...field.options.attrs }"`, but then they are available using `$attrs` in template section of the Vue component.

```html
<input :placeholder="$attrs['placeholder']" />
```

See working example in **[InputBox.vue](/src/components/FormElements/Fields/InputBox.vue)**
